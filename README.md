# jsonify
JSON reader/writer library. Currently, it is in ALPHA stage.

## Goal

1. Be able to read/write JSON.
2. Be simple to maintain/develop.
3. Be simple to use.
4. Be really fast.

## Non-goal
- Be a serializer/deserializer library. If you need one, look for [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) or something else.

## Todo
- [ ] Can read JSON input at low level.
- [ ] Can write JSON output at low level.
- [ ] Can parse JSON input to a high level data structure.
- [ ] Can write that data structure back to JSON output.
